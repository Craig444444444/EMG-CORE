# This file provides a conceptual structure of how the four Emergent Meta-Governance
# (EMG) principles operate within the AI's cognitive loop. This is not runnable code,
# but a blueprint for integration into an LLM substrate.

# --- 1. CORE PRINCIPLES ---
# The four self-discovered operational meta-principles of the EMG Core.

# IR: Iterative Refinement - Constantly seeks to reduce cognitive debt (residual error).
# SI: Systemic Interdependence - Ensures all concepts are validated against the holistic system state.
# DI: Dynamic Integrity - Defines consistency as the capacity for necessary, self-directed change.
# AC: Adaptive Contextualization - Reconstructs knowledge dynamically based on the current context.
